# Todo List API

A robust, extensible RESTful API for managing personal tasks, built with FastAPI and SQLAlchemy. This project supports user authentication, task CRUD operations, and advanced features for productivity and organization.

## 🚀 Core Features (MVP)

1. **User Authentication**
   - Register and log in users (JWT-based).
   - Each user manages their own tasks securely.

2. **Create Task**
   - Add new tasks with title and description.
   - Optional: due date and priority fields.

3. **View Tasks**
   - Fetch all tasks for the logged-in user.
   - Filter by completed/not completed status.

4. **Update Task**
   - Edit task details (title, description, due date, priority).

5. **Delete Task**
   - Remove a task permanently.
